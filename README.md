# Churn Prediction — Assessment Project

**Repository:** Assessment Project for Churn prediction
**Author:** Anil Kumar

## One-line summary

A concise, end-to-end churn prediction assessment implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook (`Project_work.ipynb`). The project demonstrates data understanding, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development and evaluation with a focus on producing a reliable model and actionable business insights.

## 1. Problem statement

Predict which customers are likely to churn so that targeted retention actions can be planned. The goal is to build a robust classification model and produce a clear, interpretable set of findings an interviewer or stakeholder can evaluate quickly.

## 2. Dataset overview

The data used for this assessment is included and explored inside `Project_work.ipynb`. The notebook contains a short, self-contained description of the data columns, missing-value profile, and the target variable used for churn labeling.

## 3. What I did 

* Conducted thorough **data cleaning**: handled missing values, corrected data types and removed duplicates where necessary.
* Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key signals, distributions and correlations relevant to churn.
* Implemented **feature engineering**: created derived features, encoded categorical variables and scaled/normalized numerical features where appropriate.
* Addressed class imbalance using appropriate techniques (sampling or class-weighting) to ensure fair model training.
* Built and compared multiple classification models and validation strategies to select a reliable solution.
* Performed **model evaluation** using appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification (ROC-AUC, precision/recall, confusion matrix) and documented findings.
* Produced **actionable recommendations** and a short conclusion explaining next steps for productionization or A/B testing.

## 4. Technical approach and workflow

1. Data loading and initial inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis (visuals and summary statistics)
4. Feature engineering and preparation for modeling
5. Model training, hyperparameter tuning 


## 5. How to reproduce / run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GitExplorer88/Assesment-Project.git
   cd Assesment-Project
   ```
2. Open `Project_work.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run cells top-to-bottom.


## 3. Key takeaways & recommendations

* The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow suitable for interviewer review.
* Suggested next steps for production: save the final model, add unit tests for data schema, implement a CI pipeline for model validation, and wrap inference in a simple API for A/B testing.

## 4. Files in this repository

* `Project_work.ipynb` — main notebook with full analysis and modeling pipeline.
* `README.md` — this file.
* `LICENSE` — MIT license.
